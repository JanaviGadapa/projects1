# Project 1: Food Delivery Time Estimation:
  Project steps :
  1. Imported Libraries : Utilized some important libraries like pandas , NumPy, seaborn , matplotlib for data handling and analysis
  2. Data Collection : data is collected from the website KAGGLE.
  2. Data Exploration : Explored and analyzed data through some methods in pandas like describe,info etc
  3. Data Analysis : Analyzed each feature and their effects on output variable using matplotlib, seaborn
  4. Data Cleaning : Handled missing values ,outliers and ensured data quality by removing duplicates.
  5. Feature Selection : selected relevent features according to the output variable.
  6. Train test split : Divide the data into train and test data to evaluate model performance.
  8. Model implementation : Implemented Regression models for the model fitting and predicting
  10. model fitting annd predict : Trained Regression model on training data and tested on test data.
  11. Model Evaluation : Asssessed the model's accuracy and performance using RMSE and mean squared error and selected the best model among all.
  12. Real time Prediction : Predicted delivery time for some data.

# Project 2: OLX WebScrapping
  Scraping: Web Scraping is an automatic way to retrieve unstructured data from a website and store them in a structured format.

Notes: Scraping makes the website traffic spike and may cause the breakdown of the website server. Thus, not all websites allow people to scrape. How do you know which websites are allowed or not? You can look at the ‘robots.txt’ file of the website. You just simply put robots.txt after the URL that you want to scrape and you will see information on whether the website host allows you to scrape the website.

In python webscraping can be done through the library selenium. selenium is a web based driver that will automate website through a web browser of choice
Scarpped Website OLX and collected data of Used Cars

  5. Feature Selection : selected relevent features according to the output variable.
  6. Train test split : Divide the data into train and test data to evaluate model performance.
  7. Data Preprocessing : converted Categorical colimns into numerical columns 
  8. Scaling : Applied Standard Scaler to normalize the data into one range.
  8. Model implementation : Implemented Classification models for the model fitting and predicting
  10. model fitting annd predict : Trained Classification models on training data and tested on test data.
  11. Model Evaluation : Asssessed the model's accuracy and performance using Confusion matrix and mean squared accuracy score and selected the best model 
  12. Real Time Prediction : Predicted the diagnosis for the future data
