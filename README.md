# Project 1: Food Delivery Time Estimation:
  Project steps :
  1. Imported Libraries : Utilized some important libraries like pandas , NumPy, seaborn , matplotlib for data handling and analysis
  2. Data Collection : data is collected from the website KAGGLE.
  2. Data Exploration : Explored and analyzed data through some methods in pandas like describe,info etc
  3. Data Analysis : Analyzed each feature and their effects on output variable using matplotlib, seaborn
  4. Data Cleaning : Handled missing values ,outliers and ensured data quality by removing duplicates.
  5. Feature Selection : selected relevent features according to the output variable.
  6. Train test split : Divide the data into train and test data to evaluate model performance.
  8. Model implementation : Implemented Regression models for the model fitting and predicting
  10. model fitting annd predict : Trained Regression model on training data and tested on test data.
  11. Model Evaluation : Asssessed the model's accuracy and performance using RMSE and mean squared error and selected the best model among all.
  12. Real time estimation : Predicted delivery time for some data.
